# AutoArtifacts SDK Features - Implementation Guide Index

This directory contains detailed implementation guides for building out the complete SDK API for AutoArtifacts. These features will transform the package from a basic component to a fully-featured, production-ready editor SDK like Tiptap.

## 📋 Feature Implementation Order

Implement in this order for proper dependency management:

### 1. ✅ Feature #5: Readonly/Editable Toggle
**File:** `FEATURE_05_READONLY_MODE.md`  
**Status:** ~90% Complete - Just needs ref API methods  
**Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL  
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

Basic readonly functionality exists. Need to expose `setEditable()` and `isEditable()` via ref.

---

### 2. ⚠️ Feature #4: State Access API
**File:** `FEATURE_04_STATE_ACCESS_API.md`  
**Status:** Not implemented  
**Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL  
**Estimated Time:** 4-6 hours  
**Dependencies:** None

Create utility functions for querying editor state (getCurrentSlide, getTotalSlides, getJSON, etc). This is foundational for other features.

---

### 3. ⚠️ Feature #3: Event Hooks/Callbacks
**File:** `FEATURE_03_EVENT_HOOKS.md`  
**Status:** Partially implemented  
**Priority:** 🟠 IMPORTANT  
**Estimated Time:** 6-8 hours  
**Dependencies:** Feature #4 (State Access API)

Expand beyond onChange/onSlideChange to include onCreate, onDestroy, onFocus, onBlur, onSelectionUpdate, onUndo, onRedo, onTransaction.

---

### 4. ⚠️ Feature #2: Commands API
**File:** `FEATURE_02_COMMANDS_API.md`  
**Status:** Partially implemented (~30% done via /src/actions)  
**Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL  
**Estimated Time:** 8-12 hours  
**Dependencies:** Feature #4 (State Access API)

Complete commands for formatting, headings, links, lists, media, slides, layouts, history, selection, and content manipulation. Includes command chaining.

---

### 5. ⚠️ Feature #1: Editor Instance API
**File:** `FEATURE_01_EDITOR_INSTANCE_API.md`  
**Status:** Partially implemented (basic ref exists)  
**Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL  
**Estimated Time:** 4-6 hours  
**Dependencies:** Features #2, #3, #4, #5 (pulls everything together)

Complete ref API that exposes all state access methods, commands, and utilities. Includes optional `useSlideEditor` hook.

- [ ] Have TypeScript configured properly

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
For each feature:
1. Test individual functions in isolation
2. Mock ProseMirror view when needed
3. Test edge cases (null, undefined, empty)

### Integration Testing
1. Test features working together
2. Test in demo app with real usage
3. Test all examples from the guides

### TypeScript Testing
1. Ensure all types are exported
2. Check autocomplete works in IDE
3. Verify no type errors

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Start Small** - Begin with Feature #5, it's mostly done
2. **Test Continuously** - Don't wait until the end
3. **Read ProseMirror Docs** - Understanding ProseMirror helps immensely
4. **Use TypeScript** - Let the compiler catch errors early
5. **Reference Tiptap** - See how they solved similar problems
6. **Document As You Go** - Update README with each feature
7. **Ask for Help** - ProseMirror has an active community
8. **Take Breaks** - This is 24-37 hours of focused work

---

## 🐛 Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: ProseMirror view is null
**Solution:** Always check `if (!view)` before accessing

### Issue: Commands don't work
**Solution:** Ensure schema has the required node/mark types

### Issue: TypeScript errors
**Solution:** Make sure all types are properly exported

### Issue: Events fire too often
**Solution:** Debounce expensive callbacks like onSelectionUpdate

### Issue: Memory leaks
**Solution:** Clean up in destroy() and useEffect cleanup

## 📞 Need Help?

If implementing these features:

1. **Read the guide thoroughly** - Most answers are there
2. **Check existing code** - See how similar things are done
3. **Console.log everything** - Debug step by step
4. **Test incrementally** - Don't write everything at once
5. **Use TypeScript errors** - They point to issues
6. **Compare with Tiptap** - See their implementation
